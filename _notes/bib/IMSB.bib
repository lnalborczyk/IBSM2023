Bayesian ideas already match your intuitions from everyday reasoning and from traditional data analysis. Simple examples of Bayesian data analysis are presented that illustrate how the information delivered by a Bayesian analysis can be directly interpreted. Bayesian approaches to null-value assessment are discussed. The article clarifies misconceptions about Bayesian methods that newcomers might have acquired elsewhere. We discuss prior distributions and explain how they are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss the relation of Bayesian data analysis to Bayesian models of mind, and we briefly discuss what methodological problems Bayesian data analysis is not meant to solve. After you have read this article, you should have a clear sense of how Bayesian data analysis works and the sort of information it delivers, and why that information is so intuitive and useful for drawing conclusions from data.},

Among frequentists in psychology, a shift of emphasis from hypothesis testing to estimation has been dubbed “the New Statistics” (Cumming, 2014). A second conceptual distinction is between frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. Our main goal in this article is to explain how Bayesian methods achieve the goals of the New Statistics better than frequentist methods. The article reviews frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and to estimation with confidence or credible intervals. The article also describes Bayesian approaches to meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, and power analysis.},

	shorttitle = {Data analysis},
	abstract = {This completely rewritten classic text features many new examples, insights, and topics including mediational, categorical, and multilevel models. Substantially reorganized, this edition provides a briefer, more streamlined examination of data analysis. Noted for its model comparison approach and unified framework based on the general linear model, the book provides readers with a greater understanding of a variety of statistical procedures. This consistent framework, including consistent vocabulary and notation, is used throughout to develop fewer but more powerful model building techniques. The authors show how all analysis of variance and multiple regression can be accomplished within this framework. The model comparison approach provides several benefits: It strengthens the intuitive understanding of the material, thereby increasing the ability to successfully analyze data in the future; It provides more control in the analysis of data so that readers can apply the techniques to a broader spectrum of questions; It reduces the number of statistical techniques that must be memorized; It teaches readers how to become data analysts instead of statisticians. The book opens with an overview of data analysis. All the necessary concepts for statistical inference used throughout the book are introduced in Chapters 2 through 4. The remainder of the book builds on these models. Chapters 5-7 focus on regression analysis, followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), mediational analyses, nonindependent or correlated errors, including multilevel modeling, and outliers and error violations. The book is appreciated by all for its detailed treatment of ANOVA, multiple regression, nonindependent observations, interactive and nonlinear models of data, and its guidance for treating outliers and other problematic aspects of data analysis. Intended for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses on data analysis, statistics, and/or quantitative methods taught in psychology, education, or other behavioral and social science departments, this book also appeals to researchers who analyze data. A protected website featuring additional examples and problems with datasets, lecture notes, PowerPoint presentations, and class-tested exam questions is available to adopters. This material uses SAS but can easily be adapted to other programs. A working knowledge of basic algebra and any multiple regression program is assumed.

	abstract = {Cet ouvrage couvre un programme complet de statistiques pour la licence de psychologie (L1 à L3), depuis les bases élémentaires de combinatoire et de probabilités jusqu'aux modèles élaborés permettant de mettre à l'épreuve des hypothèses psychologiques. Présentés à partir de données réelles, les modèles étudiés sont facilement applicables dans les champs divers de la psychologie (cognition, cognition sociale, développement de l'enfant, psychologie de la santé, psychologie du travail, psychocriminologie...). La mise en oeuvre pratique des procédures est développée dans des exercices types présentés en un format unique, de la définition du problème statistique à la conclusion psychologique. La démarche adoptée par l'auteur est celle de la comparaison de modèles : chaque situation à modéliser fait d'abord l'objet d'hypothèses psychologiques, traduites sous forme de modèles de probabilités, au sein desquels on cherche le meilleur, en termes de qualité d'ajustement et de parcimonie. Cette démarche de sélection de modèle est illustrée aussi bien avec les outils fishériens traditionnels (la valeur p), qu'avec les outils les plus récents de la statistique bayésienne (le facteur de Bayes). Les dernières recommandations de l'American Psychological Association en matière d'analyse, notamment l'inférence directe sur les tailles d'effet, on été intégrées. A ce titre, l'ouvrage intéressera autant l'étudiant que le chercheur désireux de s'initier à ces nouveaux outils. Deux librairies spécialisées pour R (R2STATS et AtelieR), librement téléchargeables en ligne et dotées d'une interface graphique, permettent de retrouver facilement tous les résultats numériques présentés dans les exemples.},

The many demonstrations that uncertainties can only combine according to the rules of the probability calculus are summarized. The conclusion is that statistical inference is firmly based on probability alone. Progress is therefore dependent on the construction of a probability model; methods for doing this are considered. It is argued that the probabilities are personal. The roles of likelihood and exchangeability are explained. Inference is only of value if it can be used, so the extension to decision analysis, incorporating utility, is related to risk and to the use of statistics in science and law. The paper has been written in the hope that it will be intelligible to all who are interested in statistics.},

	abstract = {A statistical test leads to a Type I error whenever it leads to the rejection of a null hypothesis that is in fact true. The probability of making a Type I error can be characterized in the following 3 ways: the conditional prior probability, the overall prior probability, and the conditional posterior probability. In this article, we show (a) that the alpha level can be equated with the 1st of these and (b) that it provides an upper bound for the second but (c) that it does not provide an estimate of the third, although it is commonly assumed to do so. We trace the source of this erroneous assumption first to statistical texts used by psychologists, which are generally ambiguous about which of the 3 interpretations is intended at any point in their discussions of Type I errors and which typically confound the conditional prior and posterior probabilities. Underlying this, however, is a more general fallacy in reasoning about probabilities, and we suggest that this may be the result of erroneous inferences about probabilistic conditional statements. Finally, we consider the possibility of estimating the (posterior) probability of a Type I error in situations in which the null hypothesis is rejected and, hence, the proportion of statistically significant results that may be Type I errors.

Even though intrinsic subject matter difficulties (20 are listed) contribute to this, the excessive reliance on significance testing is partly responsible (Ronald A. Fisher). Karl Popper's approach, with modifications, would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of "significant differences" are little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions. Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values ("consistency tests") are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, 2nd-order differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94\% success with no false negatives.

Median power to detect small, medium, and large effects was 0.12, 0.44, and 0.73, reflecting no improvement through the past half-century. This is so because sample sizes have remained small. Assuming similar true effect sizes in both disciplines, power was lower in cognitive neuroscience than in psychology. Journal impact factors negatively correlated with power. Assuming a realistic range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, false report probability is likely to exceed 50\% for the whole literature. In light of our findings, the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic, and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.},
