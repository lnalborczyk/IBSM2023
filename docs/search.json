    "section": "What is Bayesian statistical modeling?",
    "text": "What is Bayesian statistical modeling?\nThe Bayesian approach involves treating each entity (e.g., observed variables, model parameters, missing data) as random variables characterised by probability distributions. In a Bayesian analysis, each unknown entity is assigned an a priori distribution that represents a state of knowledge prior to observing the data. Once the data have been observed, Bayes’ theorem is used to update the a priori distribution into an a posteriori distribution. The a posteriori distribution is the goal of a Bayesian analysis and can be summarised by point values or intervals, and interpreted directly within a coherent probabilistic framework.\nThis approach differs - both philosophically and in practice - from the traditional frequentist approach, which makes up the majority of training courses. One of the advantages of the Bayesian approach is that it enables the analyst to solve problems that are difficult, if not impossible, for the traditional frequentist approach.\nIn the course of the proposed examples, we’ll realise that even in simple modeling situations, the Bayesian approach enables more natural and flexible probabilistic reasoning than the inferential machinery of the frequentist approach. Bayesian statistical modeling represents an attractive alternative to frequentist approaches in that it offers a coherent framework for statistical modeling. The Bayesian approach makes it possible to build and fit complex models while offering relatively intuitive conclusions that incorporate all the uncertainty intrinsic to the inferential process."
